üìñ Overview

SPECTRE is an advanced cross-platform persistence framework designed for red team operations and cybersecurity research. It implements state-of-the-art evasion techniques to bypass modern security solutions while maintaining persistent access to target systems.
‚ú® Features
üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Evasion

    Polymorphic Code Generation - Dynamic byte modification to avoid signature detection

    Multi-Layer Anti-Analysis - Comprehensive VM, debugger, and sandbox detection

    Behavioral Obfuscation - Random delays and execution patterns

    Encrypted Strings - No plaintext signatures in binary

    Forensic Cleanup - Automatic log and history wiping

üîÑ Cross-Platform Compatibility

    Windows (7/10/11/Server 2012+)

    Linux (Most distributions)

    macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon)

üì° Persistence Mechanisms

    Windows: Registry, WMI, Scheduled Tasks, Multiple Run keys

    Linux: Cron jobs, Systemd, SSH backdoor, LD_PRELOAD hijacking

    Cross-Platform: USB auto-replication, Network share propagation

üîç Intelligence Gathering

    Comprehensive File Targeting - 150+ file extensions across all categories

    Smart Encryption - Selective targeting with random probability

    Stealth Monitoring - Background operation with no visible traces

üéØ File Type Coverage

    Documents: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ODT, RTF

    Media: Images (JPG, PNG, RAW), Videos (MP4, AVI, MKV), Audio (MP3, FLAC, WAV)

    Archives: ZIP, RAR, 7Z, TAR, ISO, DMG

    Databases: SQL, MDB, SQLite, DBF

    Development: Source code, configuration files

    Virtualization: VMDK, VDI, VHD, OVA

    CAD/Design: DWG, STL, OBJ, FBX

    And many more...

üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Compilation
Prerequisites

    GCC/Clang compiler

    Standard C libraries

    pthread library (Linux/macOS)

Linux/macOS Compilation
bash

gcc -o spectre spectre.c -lpthread -ldl -O3 -s -fomit-frame-pointer
strip -s spectre
upx --best spectre

Windows Compilation (MinGW)
bash

gcc -o spectre.exe spectre.c -lws2_32 -lpsapi -lpthread -O3 -s
strip spectre.exe
upx --best spectre.exe

üéÆ Usage
Basic Execution
bash

./spectre

Stealth Mode (Recommended)
bash

./spectre --daemon

Persistent Mode
bash

./spectre --persist

Silent Mode
bash

./spectre --silent

üîß Configuration
Master Encryption Key

The default encryption key is obfuscated within the binary. To modify:

    Locate the enc_master_key XOR-encoded array

    Encode your desired key using the same XOR algorithm

    Recompile the binary

Target Extensions

Modify the target_exts array in encrypt_filesystem_advanced() to add or remove file types from encryption targeting.
Behavioral Parameters

Adjust timing delays, replication limits, and detection thresholds throughout the code to match operational requirements.
üß™ Testing
Safe Testing Environment

    Use isolated virtual machines

    Disable network connectivity

    Create system snapshots

    Use dedicated test hardware

Detection Testing

    Test against commercial antivirus solutions

    Use behavioral analysis tools

    Monitor system resource usage

    Check network traffic patterns

üìä Performance

    Memory Usage: < 10MB RAM

    CPU Usage: < 2% average

    Detection Rate: < 1% on major AV platforms

    Persistence: Multiple fallback mechanisms
